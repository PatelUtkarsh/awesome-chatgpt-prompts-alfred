# üîçüß† Alfred Plugin for ChatGPT Prompts

This is a plugin for the Alfred app that provides a search feature using the array of prompts from the [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) project.

## Functionality

This plugin allows users to search for prompts that can be used with the ChatGPT model for generating conversational responses. The array of prompts is sourced from the awesome-chatgpt-prompts project, which is continuously updated by contributors.

The plugin fetches the latest data from the API provided by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) every 24 hours to ensure that the data is always up-to-date.

## Installation

To install the plugin, simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/bluewolfali/awesome-chatgpt-prompts-alfred.alfredworkflow) and double-click on the `.alfredworkflow` file to add it to Alfred.

## Usage

Once installed, users can access the plugin by typing in the keyword `cp` followed by their search query. The plugin will display a list of prompts matching the search query, and the user can select one to copy it to their clipboard.
